## Customizable replacement for the system **MessageBox** class ##

DataTools.MessageBoxEx is a highly customizable replacement for the system MessageBox class for both WPF and WinForms applications. 

It is intended to look and behave as closely as possible to the native MessageBox.

*(The message box will render in the [Visual Style](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.application.enablevisualstyles?view=netcore-3.1) of the calling application.)*

- **Resource-based Internationalization**
    
    Language resources from your own project can be referenced by MessageBoxEx to render standard dialog types by using the
    [ResourceTextConfig](https://github.com/ironywrit/MessageBoxEx/wiki/P_DataTools_MessageBoxEx_MessageBoxEx_ResourceTextConfig) static
    property.

    * [See the example project for an example.](https://github.com/nmoschkin/MessageBoxEx/tree/master/TestApp)
    Note that the example project contains two resources, _AppResources.resx_ and _AppResources.fr.resx_.
    The _fr_ in the second file is the two letter ISO language code for French.  Applications using resource-based internationalization
    will automatically pick the best set of resources to use based on the user's current system language and culture settings, but this
    behavior can be overridden.  Browse [ResourceTextConfig.cs](https://github.com/nmoschkin/MessageBoxEx/blob/master/MessageBoxEx/Classes/ResourceTextConfig.cs) to see what's involved.
        
- **If you prefer the old-fashioned 3D look**

    The message box will render in the [**Visual Style**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.application.enablevisualstyles?view=netcore-3.1) of
    the calling application.  

    **You can override the default visual style of your application by launching the message box in a new process using [ShowInNewProcess](https://github.com/ironywrit/MessageBoxEx/wiki/M_DataTools_MessageBoxEx_MessageBoxEx_ShowInNewProcess).**
